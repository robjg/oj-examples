		<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

		<p>Often we only know configuration values when the jobs run.
		A file name might contain a date, an FTP host name might change
		with environment, etc. Oddjob allows us
		to specify configuration that is evaluated only when the job runs. The
		configuration values are either Java properties, (key/value pairs) or
		properties of other jobs.</p>
		
		<p>To specify that a configuration value should be evaluated at runtime
			we use syntax of the form <span class="expression">${<i>expression</i>}</span>
			for simple property evaluation or <span class="expression">#{<i>expression</i>}</span>
				for script evaluation.</p>
		
		<p>For instance echo job could be configured with the text property
			<span class="expression">Hello ${someone.name}</span></p>

		<p>To evaluate name Oddjob first checks for a java property called
		'someone.name', and then looks for another job with an id of 'someone' and a property 'name'.</p>

		<h4 id="defining">Defining Properties</h4>
		
		<p>Properties are defined within an Oddjob configuration using the 
		<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/values/properties/PropertiesJob.html">
		properties</a> job. When the job runs, the properties it defines
		become available to other jobs. When the property job is reset or
		deleted, the property definitions are removed and are no longer 
		available to configure other jobs.</p>

		<p>Properties can also be defined outside Oddjob and inherited. The
		ways in which Oddjob can inherit properties are:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Via Java System properties set in the usual way using the -D option 
			on Java start up.</li>
			<li>From properties defined in a file name <code>oddjob.properties</code>
			in the users home directory.</li>
			<li>Any properties defined in an Oddjob that is running our Oddjob as
			a nested Oddjob.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>If a property of the same name is defined twice the value of when
		it was set first set is used instead of the value defined later. This
		means that external properties take precedence over internal properties.
		The order of precedence of external properties is as they are listed
		above.</p>

		<h4 id="id">Job Identity</h4>
		
		<p>If a property is not defined as a name value pair, then Oddjob will
		attempt to evaluate the configuration expression as a property 
		of job.</p>
		
		<p>In order to identify a job so that it may be referenced from another job
		it must be given an 'id'. An id must be unique and must not contain the
			characters <code>.()[].</code> or <code>/</code>.
		</p>

		<p>To demonstrate using a job's id we'll create a job
		that mirrors the state of our ExecJob.</p>
		
		<p>We'll start with our Exec Job as the only child of a Sequential 
		Job.<p>
		
		We need to give our Exec Job an id which is quite simple. Open it in
		Designer and in the id field on the 
		right enter 'my-job'.</p>
		
		<a href="images/runtime1.gif"><img src="images/runtime1.gif" 
				height="320" width="500" alt="Setting the Job Id"/></a>
		
		<p>Next we need to add a mirror job. In the jobs list of
		the Sequential Job, add a state:mirror job.</p>

		<a href="images/runtime2.gif"><img src="images/runtime2.gif" 
				height="320" width="500" alt="Create a Schedule"/></a>

		<p>Select the new node and in the job field we need to tell it
		the job to mirror. We do this
			using the notation <span class="expression"><i>${job-id}</i></span> in the configuration field.
			Oddjob will recognise a <span class="expression">${ }</span>
		character sequence and takes what is between the curly brackets to 
		be the id of job we wish to reference. This happens every time the 
		mirror job is run.</p>
		
		<p>So in the 'Job' field enter the text <span class="expression">${my-job}</span>.</p>

		<a href="images/runtime3.gif"><img src="images/runtime3.gif" 
				height="320" width="500" alt="The Schedule Details Dialog"/></a>

		<p>Run the sequence, and then reset and run just the Exec Job. You 
		Should see that the mirror job mirrors its state.</p>

		<h4 id="properties">Job Properties</h4>
		
		<p>The configuration settings made in Oddjob Designer set what are known
		as the job's properties. The 'Command' field of the ExecJob
		set a property called 'command'. </p>

		<p>Just as you can reference a job in the configuration file, you can also
		reference a property of a job. The notation for accessing a property is
			<span class="expression"><i>${job-id.job-property}</i></span>. </p>

		<p>As an example let's create a new simple configuration. In Oddjob Explorer 
		select <b>New</b> from the <b>File</b> menu.
		Set a <b>sequential</b> job as Oddjob's only job, and then add
		an <b>echo</b> job to it. Set the id of 
		the job to "my-echo" and the 'Text' field (or 'text' property)
		to "This will be displayed twice!".</p>
		
		<a href="images/runtime4.gif"><img src="images/runtime4.gif" 
				height="320" width="500" alt="First Echo Job"/></a>
				
		<p>Add another echo job to the SequentialJob node but in this echo
			jobs text property enter the value <span class="expression">${my-echo.text}</span>.</p>
		
		<a href="images/runtime5.gif"><img src="images/runtime5.gif" 
				height="320" width="500" alt="Second Echo Job"/></a>
		
		<p>Save the configuration and then run the Oddjob job. The jobs
		will run immediately and in the console you should see that the
		text has been displayed twice.</p>
		
		<a href="images/runtime6.gif"><img src="images/runtime6.gif" 
				height="320" width="500" alt="Running Two Echo Jobs"/></a>
				
		<p>When setting the text property of the second job, Oddjob looked 
			up the job with the id of <span class="expression">'my-echo'</span> and then looked
			up the property <span class="expression">'text'</span> of that job.</p>
		
		<p>This substitution is the
		first thing that happens when a job is run. Altering the order of the jobs
		in the example would be OK because the fixed text of the first job 
		is set when the
		job is loaded. Adding a third job to run before the other two which relied
		on the second jobs text property wouldn't work because the second job
		hadn't run and therefore hadn't had its text property set. Adding the 
		third job after the first two would be OK.</p>
		
		<p>Oddjob supports more complicated property specifications but for most
			simple situations <span class="expression">${<i>id.property</i>}</span> is all that is needed.</p>
		
		<h4 id="variables">Variables</h4>
		
		<p>Most jobs have a
		fixed properties with names that never change, the
			<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/values/VariableJob.html">variables</a> job has properties
		which are defined dynamically at runtime.</p>

		<p>This is useful for defining something that is more than text that is shared between several
		jobs such as a <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/io/FilesType.html">files</a> list or an SQL
			<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/sql/ConnectionType.html">connection</a>. Text properties are
			still better set with the
			<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/values/properties/PropertiesJob.html">properties</a></p>
		
		<p>As an example we'll replace our first echo job in the previous example 
		with a variables job. Delete the first echo job. Select the 'SequentialJob' and add a new 
		<b>variables</b> job Jobs table. The variables job appears
		at the end of the list which isn't very useful because as its properties
		are created when it runs so we need it to run first. Use the mouse
		to drag the Variables job above the Echo job. 
		Now configure the variables job
		by giving it an 'Id', say 'vars' and in the Named Values section select
		a type of 'value', and enter a name of 'greeting' and then enter 'Hello' in
		the value cell.</p>
		
		<a href="images/runtime7.gif"><img src="images/runtime7.gif" 
				height="320" width="500" alt="The Variables Job"/></a>
				
		<p>We have created a variables job that has property called 'greeting' that
		will be available when the job runs. </p>
		
		<p>We need to change our runtime property in the echo job to match our new
			configuration i.e. <span class="expression">${vars.greeting}</span>. We can then click OK to
		take our new configuration back into 
		Oddjob Explorer and when we run the Sequential job we will see in the
		console output 'Hello'</p>

		<h4 id="name">Name</h4>

		<p>The <b>name</b> attribute of job is a special case. It is evaluated when configuration is loaded, not when
		the job is run. This is because name is used by jobs in the UI to identify them. Try changing the
		name of an echo job to <span class="expression">Echo for ${user.name}</span> and see what happens.
		</p>

		<p>
			The main use case for this is actually driven by the
			<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jobs/structural/ForEachJob.html">foreach</a> Job. Check out the examples
			there to understand why.
		</p>

		<h4 id="script">Script Configuration</h4>

		<p>
			Expressions of the form <span class="expression">#{<i>expression</i>}</span> are passed to Java's
			internal scripting engine. Not all versions of Java have one. Try setting the text of Echo job
			to <span class="expression">2 + 2 is #{2 + 2}</span> and running it to see if you have one.
		</p>

		<p>
			If the above fails, then you can download the Nashorn jar and drop it in Oddjob's <code>lib</code>
			directory. Scripting is quite advanced, you probably won't need it, so more on this is beyond the
			scope this manual.
		</p>

		<h4 id="nested">Oddjobs within Oddjobs</h4>

		<p>As you saw in the examples, an Oddjob job can be <i>nested</i> within
		another Oddjob job. It is possible to access a job within the 
			using the notation <span class="expression"><i>${oddjob-id/job-id.property}</i></span> but more on this in the
		next section.</p>
