        <h4 id="tasks">Tasks</h4>

		<p>The idea of a Task was introduced in Oddjob 1.5 as a way to get round the limitations of running 
		jobs remotely with different properties. Doing this locally has always been relatively simple
            with <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/input/InputJob.html">input</a> but remotely required waiting for
            a property to be set.
		</p>
		<p>
		Here's the server side of such an arrangement:
        </p>
        
{@oddjob.xml.file examples/userguide/tasks1.xml}
    
        <p>
        And here's the client side:
        </p>

{@oddjob.xml.file examples/userguide/tasks2.xml}

        <p>The server waits for the <code>greeting</code> property to be set on the 
        <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/values/VariablesJob.html">variables</a> job and then echos
        the value.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Client prompts the user for input and then sets this property remotely with the 
        <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/values/SetJob.html">set</a> job. Now this works, but it's ugly. 
        </p>
        
        <p>Here's the same problem with a
        <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jobs/tasks/TaskExecutionService.html">task-service</a> on
        the server:</p>
        

{@oddjob.xml.file examples/userguide/tasks3.xml}

        <p>And here's the client:</p>
        
{@oddjob.xml.file examples/userguide/tasks4.xml}

        <p>The client gets input from the user as before, but reads the request from the
            <span class="expression">requests</span>
        property of the service on the server. The 
        <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jobs/tasks/TaskRequest.html">task-request</a> then requests the 
        task executes the request on the service on the server.
        </p>

        <p>
        Both the above examples above can be run by specifying a <span class="expression">server.address</span>
            property when running the client,
        and running the server with a JMX port as outlined in 
        the <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jmx/JMXServerJob.html">server</a> documentation.
        The client and server can also be run together in the same JVM with no connection property set on the client as
        they are for the tests.
        </p>
        
        <p>When running either the client or server from explorer, if the service is selected the job menu
        contains an <b>'Execute'</b> option, which when selected will prompt for the properties of the task and then
        execute the task.</p>

        <a href="images/tasks.jpg"><img src="images/tasks.jpg"
                height="320" width="500" alt="Executing a Task from Oddjob Explorer"/></a>
                
        <p>The web interface also supports executing jobs and produces pop-up form to prompt for properties
        before executing the task.</p>
        		
        <ul>Limitations</ul>

        <p>The current task service only supports a single execution at a time. If another request occurs while
        the task is executing it will be ignored. A parallel version that supports concurrent executions
        will be developed at some point in the future.
        </p>

        <h4 id="beanbus">Bean Bus</h4>

        <p>Bean Bus provides data pipeline functionality within Oddjob. A bus generally consists of
        a Bus Driver that drives data down the pipeline to subsequent destinations.</p>

        <p>Bean Bus is likely to be of most use to developers who wish to quickly get data from one place to another.
            A sister project of Oddjob,  <a href="https://github.com/robjg/dido">DIDO</a> provides Bean Bus
            compatible components for moving data between Databases, CSV files, JSON files and Excel.</p>

        <p>For more on bean bus, look at the <b><code>bus:</code></b> prefixed jobs in the reference,
        starting with <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/beanbus/bus/BasicBusService.html">bus:bus</a></p>

        <h4 id="web">Web</h4>

        <p>In addition to the Web UI Oddjob provides basic wrappers around Jetty to provide a
            <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jetty/JettyHttpServer.html">web:server</a>
            and <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jetty/JettyHttpClient.html">web:client</a>
        </p>

        <p>The server exposes Jetty's pattern of pluggable handlers. Handlers provided out of the box with Oddjob
        are:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt><a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jetty/ResourceHandlerType.html">web:resource</a></dt>
            <dd>Publishes files or resources. Use this to create a simple web server.</dd>

            <dt><a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jetty/OddjobRestHandler.html">web:oddjob-rest</a></dt>
            <dd>Provide a web service interface to Oddjob. Used to provide the UI in version 1.5 but has
            been replaced by the bespoke Http/Web Socket handler below in 1.6.</dd>

            <dt><a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/web/WebServerHandlerJmx.html">web:remote-handler</a></dt>
            <dd>The Handler for Oddjob's web UI.</dd>

        </dl>
