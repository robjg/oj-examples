		<h4 id="hierachies">Job Hierarchies</h4>
		
		<p>Oddjob jobs are arranged in a tree like hierarchy with an Oddjob job at the
		root. Only some jobs can have children, and only some jobs can have more than
		one child. Our root Oddjob job can only have one child.</p>

		<p>Execution of jobs starts at the root and fans out down the tree like a
		Domino Cascade. The three main ways of controlling this cascade are using the 
		jobs:</p>
		
		<dl>
		<dt><a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jobs/structural/SequentialJob.html">sequential</a></dt>
		<dd>Executes it's child jobs in sequence - only executing the next if it's 
		predecessor completes.</dd>
		<dt><a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jobs/structural/ParallelJob.html">parallel</a>
		<dd>Executes it's child jobs all at once.</dd>
		<dt><a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jobs/structural/JobFolder.html">folder</a>
		<dd>Protects it's children from the execution cascade. It's children must be
		executed in some other way.</dd>
		</dl>
				
		<p>While execution cascades down the tree job, state reflects up the tree. 
		Generally a parent reflects the worst state of any of it's children - so a parent
		is in an Exception state if any of it's children are.</p>

		<h4 id="sequential">A Sequential Example</h4>

		<p>To demonstrate a sequential series of jobs lets change the Oddjob 
		configuration we created in the previous section
		so that our ExecJob is surrounded by some useful information jobs.</p>
		
		<p>Because our Oddjob root can only have one child we need to cut out
		our ExecJob</p>
		
		<a href="images/children2.gif"><img src="images/children2.gif" 
				height="320" width="500" alt="Cut out the ExecJob."/></a>
		
		<p>Next create a new <b>sequential</b> child of Oddjob, and create
		two <b>echo</b> jobs. Echo jobs just echo some text to the console.</p>
		
		<a href="images/children3.gif"><img src="images/children3.gif" 
				height="320" width="500" alt="Create two echo jobs."/></a>

		<p>Configure the echo jobs to display something before the 
		ExecJob has run.
		</p>
		
		<a href="images/children4.gif"><img src="images/children4.gif" 
				height="320" width="500" alt="Configure Before"/></a>
		
		<p>And after the ExecJob has run.</p>
		
		<a href="images/children5.gif"><img src="images/children5.gif" 
				height="320" width="500" alt="Configure After"/></a>
				
		<p>Then click OK, to go back to Oddjob explorer and paste back our
		ExecJob onto the sequential job.</p>
		
		<a href="images/children6.gif"><img src="images/children6.gif" 
				height="320" width="500" alt="Paste back the ExecJob"/></a>

		<p>Now the order is wrong, so use the mouse to drag the ExecJob to 
		between the Before and After.</p>
				
		<a href="images/children7.gif"><img src="images/children7.gif" 
				height="320" width="500" alt="Drag the ExecJob"/></a>
				
		<p>And finally save the configuration and run the sequence.</p>
		
		<a href="images/children8.gif"><img src="images/children8.gif" 
				height="320" width="500" alt="Cut out the ExecJob"/></a>

		<p>And thats how easy it is to create a Sequence of Jobs.</p>
		
		<h4 id="nesting">Nesting Oddjob</h4>
		
		<p>
		Oddjob is just a job. It's job is to read a configuration, that is
		normally a file, and create the jobs required by the configuration
		and wire them together. It then runs the top most job in the 
		hierarchy and reflects it's state.</p>
		
		<p>		
		By choosing a child type that is Oddjob we create
		a nested Oddjob. Nested Oddjobs allow large configurations to be
		broken down into more manageable units and they also allow
		repeated sections of configuration to be separated out so they
		need only be written once.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The examples are an example of nesting Oddjobs. Each example is
		a separate nested Oddjob. Take a look at <code>examples.xml</code>
		to see how it works.
		</p>
		
		<p>Configuration values can be passed into a nested Oddjob using 
		either the
		<code>args</code>, <code>export</code> and <code>properties</code>
		properties. The <code>export</code> property allows any type to
		be passed, such as a connection definition or even a reference
		to a job. The other two properties only pass text.	The
		Reference Guide for Oddjob has more information on these properties.
		</p> 
		
		<p>A nested Oddjob can also have it's own job definitions. See
		the Developer Guide for more information on this.
