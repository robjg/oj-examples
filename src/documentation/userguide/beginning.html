		<h4>Starting Oddjob</h4>
		
		<p>To start using Oddjob double-click the <code>run-oddjob.jar</code>
		 file in the
		top level oddjob-@version@ that was created when you installed Oddjob.
		</p>
		
		<a href="images/ojfolder.gif"><img src="images/ojfolder.gif"
				height="200" width="300" alt="The Oddjob Installation Folder"/></a>
				
		<p>
		You will be presented with a rather uninspiring empty frame with a single
		<b>File</b> menu item. This is Oddjob Explorer.</p>

		<a href="images/beginning1.gif"><img src="images/beginning1.gif"
				height="200" width="300" alt="Blank Explorer Window"/></a>
		
		<p>Oddjob Explorer is the primary method for monitoring and controlling
		jobs in Oddjob. To get started with Oddjob Explorer, 
		we must open a configuration
		file containing the jobs we want Oddjob to run. Let's
		take a look at the examples shipped with Oddjob.</p>

		<a name="examples"></a>
		<h4>Loading the Examples</h4>
		
		<p>Select <b>Open</b> from the <b>File</b> menu, open the <code>examples</code>
		directory and select <code>oddjob.xml</code>. A Tree panel should appear on 
		the left, with a green tick as the root node, and a panel with 
		some tabbed panes should appear on the right.
		Expand the tree and there will be a folder with some blue arrows in it.</p>

		<a href="images/beginning2.gif"><img src="images/beginning2.gif"
				height="200" width="300" alt="The Loaded Examples"/></a>
				
		<p>So we have a green tick, a folder, and some blue arrows. What's all
		this about? When we opened the file, Oddjob Explorer used an 
		<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/Oddjob.html">Oddjob</a> job to
		load the file and create the other jobs. This Oddjob job is the 
		King (or Queen) of
		jobs - Nothing happens in Oddjob without one. The topmost node in
		our tree view is that
		Oddjob job. The green tick showed it ran OK.</p>
		
		<p>Next is the folder. Using folders to group 
		jobs in is analogous to using folders on your
		hard drive for grouping files in. Folders can be nested in other folders 
		allowing your jobs to be grouped and organised in any way you choose. A 
		folder can be shared on a network allowing your jobs to be scheduled from
		a server or run manually from another Oddjob Explorer on another
		computer. Exciting stuff - but back to our simple folder of examples...</p>
		
		<p>Our folder contains a lot of blue arrows. These are jobs that are
		ready to run. Since our folder is not shared on a network, the only way
		these job are going to run is if we run them manually. Let's run the first
		job 'Simple Example'. Select the node and then select the <b>Job</b> 
		menu and select <b>Run</b>. The blue arrow changes to a green tick
		but also the job now has a child, and that is 
		also a green tick. What happened? The job we ran was another Oddjob job,
		preconfigured with the name of the file containing our example job.
		This Oddjob job loaded the example job and this time ran it (because it wasn't 
		in a folder).</p>

		<a href="images/beginning3.gif"><img src="images/beginning3.gif"
				height="200" width="300" alt="The Loaded Examples"/></a>
				
		<p>The ability to nest Oddjob jobs within each other allows very
		large scale complicated business processes to be defined in small
		manageable chunks. Oddjob jobs can be scheduled just like other jobs
		or they can be run automatically by not placing them in folders. If we
		changed the folder to be a <i>parallel</i> job all examples would run 
		at once, if we changed it to be a <i>sequential</i> job, all the jobs would 
		run one after the other. Very flexible things are Oddjob jobs.</p>
		
		<a name="state"></a>
		<h4>Job States</h4>
		<p>The green tick and blue arrow indicate what <i>state</i> a job is in.
		A job can be in one of five states. These are:</p>
		
		<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/right_blue.gif" alt="Blue Arrow"/></td>
				<td>Ready</td>
				<td>The job is ready to be executed. A job will only execute
				if it is 'Ready'</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/triangle_green.gif" alt="Green Triangle"/></td>
				<td>Executing</td>
				<td>The job is executing.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/tick_green.gif" alt="Green Tick"/></td>
				<td>Complete</td>
				<td>The job has completed successfully.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/cross.gif" alt="Black Cross"/></td>
				<td>Incomplete</td>
				<td>The job ran but was not able to complete -
				e.g. a file was not available.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/asterix_red.gif" alt="Red Splodge"/></td>
				<td>Exception</td><td>Something unexpected happened during the running
				of the job - e.g. a network connection failed.</td>	
			</tr>
		</table>		

		<p>You may also see the icons <img src="images/triangle_red.gif" alt="Red Triangle"/>
		to indicate that a job is stopping or 
		<img src="images/dot_blue.gif" alt="Blue Dot"/> to indicate that it is
		sleeping. For both these icons the actual <i>state</i> of the job is still
		'Executing'.</p>
		
		<a name="resetting"></a>
		<h4>Resetting and Rerunning A Job</h4>
		
		<p>Now we will try and run a job again. Select the 'Greeting' job
		and then try and select <b>Run</b> from the <b>Job</b> menu. It isn't
		available. A job must be reset to the ready state before it can be 
		executed again. There are two different types of reset that can be 
		applied to a job, known as a hard or a soft reset. The origins of 
		this feature derive from the requirement that an automated retry need 
		only rerun
		the incomplete or failed jobs in a partially complete sequence of jobs.
		A soft reset will reset an <i>InComplete</i> state job or an <i>Exception</i>
		state job
		but will not reset a <i>Complete</i> state job. A hard reset will reset any 
		job that
		has finished executing. </p>
		
		<p>As we would like to manually
		reset a complete job we only have one option which is a 'hard reset'. Select
		<b>Hard Reset</b> from the <b>Job</b> menu. The job should go back to the
		ready state and we can run it again.</p>
