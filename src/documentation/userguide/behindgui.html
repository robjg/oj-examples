		<h4 id="basics">The Basics</h4>
		
		<p>Oddjob Designer provides a user interface onto an Oddjob configuration
		file but it has its limitations. At the moment it doesn't even validate
		the configuration. At some point you will have to understand the raw 
		configuration files and in this guide that point is now.</p>

		<p>Oddjob configuration files are written in XML. If you don't know 
		XML then Google for a tutorial - it will take about an
		hour to pick up the basics.</p>
		
		<p>Each Oddjob file
			contains an Oddjob and may contain 0 or 1 jobs for Oddjob to run.</p>

		<p>A file with no job for oddjob to run is a complete waste
			of time but perfectly legal. The document element must 
			always be &lt;oddjob&gt;.</p>
			
	{@oddjob.xml.file examples/userguide/behindgui1.xml}
				
		<p>A file with one job would be something like:</p>
		
	{@oddjob.xml.file examples/userguide/behindgui2.xml}
		
		<p>Here we are defining a property called 'job'. The element name 'echo' is
		used to create the type of job it is.</p>

		<p>Note that the attribute text is used to set the 'text' property
		of the echo job.</p>
		
		<p>Changing the root job to be 
		<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jobs/structural/SequentialJob.html">sequential</a>
		allows us to add more jobs.</p>
		
	{@oddjob.xml.file examples/userguide/behindgui3.xml}
	
		<h4 id="properties">Property Elements</h4>
		
		<p>We are already seeing that sometimes attributes are used to define properties
		of a job (like the text property of the echo job), and sometimes
		elements are (like job and jobs). By default text and numbers are set using 
		attributes and more complicated properties are set using elements. This can
		be changed on a job by job basis but should be documented in the reference 
		guide when it is.</p>

		<p>Here is a more complicated example - we see the &lt;scheduling:timer&gt; job
		(which we'll learn more about later) being configured with 
		both elements that declare a job property and a schedule property. Note that schedules are 
		in a different XML namespace.</p>

	{@oddjob.xml.file examples/userguide/behindgui4.xml}

		<p>All this XML is probably looking a bit ungainly but there is a pattern to it
		that makes understanding it a bit easier. Here's the pattern in the previous
		example:</p>

<pre class="xml"><i>
&lt;oddjob&gt;
 &lt;property&gt;
  &lt;type&gt;
   &lt;property&gt;
    &lt;type/&gt;
   &lt;/property&gt;
   &lt;property&gt;
    &lt;type/&gt;
   &lt;/property&gt;
  &lt;/type&gt;
 &lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/oddjob&gt;
</i></pre>

	<p>Do you See it? Elements Are either property elements,  which are the name of the property being set,
	or type elements which are the type of property - be it a job property (copy, delete) or other 
	value property (file, schedule).</p>

	<h4 id="runtime">Runtime Property Elements</h4>
	
		<p>We saw in the last section that properties can be set from other job's
		properties when the job runs. However we only saw how this worked in attribute
		properties using
		the <i>${id.property}</i> construct. When the property is defined by
		an element
		use the 'value' element type to define a reference.</p>
		
		<p>This file will have exactly the same effect as the previous example.</p>
		
	{@oddjob.xml.file examples/userguide/behindgui5.xml}
		
	<h4 id="advanced">Advanced Property Access</h4>
		
		<p>In addition to accessing the simple properties of a job using the 
		notation <i>${job-id.property}</i> Oddjob also supports setting and 
		getting <i>indexed</i> properties <i>mapped</i> properties and <i>nested</i>
		properties.</p>
		
		<p>An indexed property is when a job provides a property which is a list
		that contains a number of items and supports accessing those items 
		individually using it position in the list which is the items index. Not
		many jobs support indexed access to properties because it is seldom
		required. The notable exception is the Oddjob job which itself which 
		has the 'args' property which is a list of arguments that can be used
		in the configuration file.</p>
		
		<p>The notation for an indexed property is <i>${job-id.property[index]}</i>.</p>
		
		<p>A mapped property is when a job provides a property which is a map of
		keys to values and a particular value can be extracted using the key. Where
		they are available their exact use is documented in the reference.</p> 
		
		<p>The notation for an indexed property is <i>${job-id.property(key)}</i>.</p>

		<p>A nested property is where the job provides a property that itself
		has properties. These are rare but the format should be noted.</p>
		
		<p>The notation for a mapped property is <i>${job-id.property.sub-property}</i>.</p>
		
	<h4 id="nested">Properties of Oddjobs within Oddjobs</h4>

		<p>The jobs and properties of a nested Oddjob are available using the path
		like notation <i>${nested-oddjob-id/job-id.property}</i></p>
		
		<p>Here is an Oddjob configuration that contains an Oddjob job. The nested
		Oddjob runs the configuration nested.xml</p>.
		
	{@oddjob.xml.file examples/userguide/behindgui6.xml}

 		<p>If nested.xml contains</p>
 		
	{@oddjob.xml.file examples/userguide/nested.xml}

		<p>Running the outer Oddjob would result in the message being displayed
		twice.</p>
 
 		<p>One interesting point is that the nested Oddjob has two sides. On the
 		outside it is is fred and on the inside it is jane. On the outside 
 		${fred/jane.name} is exactly the same as ${fred.name} which is Fred. On 
 		the inside it is only accessible as jane, it has no knowledge of being fred,
 		although ${jane.name} is still 'Fred'</p>
 
 		<p>There is theoretically no limit to the number of nested Oddjobs and the
 		property access notation just expands in the style <i>${a/b/c.property}</i> 
 		as might be expected.</p>
 
 		<p>The nested oddjob configuration was defined using '${this.dir}/nested.xml'
 		- Oddjob exposes the directory of it's configuration file using a read-only 
 		property called 'dir', and the parent Oddjob has been given the id 'this' so
 		our configuration file expression expands to 'The file nested.xml in the same 
 		directory as the configuration file of our parent Oddjob'.</p>
