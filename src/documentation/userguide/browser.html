		<h4 id="installing">Installing</h4>

		<p>Oddjob comes with a service to run an embedded web server (Jetty) pre-configured to provide 
		a Web Service and Browser Application. To quickly see the Web App at work, open the 
	    <code>examples/oddjob-web.xml</code> Oddjob file and start the top job. 	
		Then point your browser at <a href="http://localhost:8080" target="_top">http://localhost:8080</a>
		and it will look something like this:</p>

        <p>Oddjob 1.5 replaces the previous JSF version with one written as a server
        side Web Service and a Typescript and JQuery client. It is very much a 
        work in progress.</p> 
        
        <p>Unlike previous versions, the Web App is not pre-packaged 
        as a War, although it would be possible to build one from artifacts in
        the <code>oj-web</code> project if required.</p>
		
		<h4 id="configuring">Configuring</h4>

		<p>Oddjob provides a very thin wrapper around Jetty and follows Jetty's pattern of
		allowing pluggable handlers. Oddjob currently exposes a very limited subset of Jetty's
		configuration options. See the <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jetty/JettyHttpServer.html">web:server</a>
		documentation for more details.</p>
		
		<p>The <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jetty/OddjobWebHandler.html">web:oddjob-web</a> Handler provides
		the handler for the Oddjob web service and the single page web application client. It provides a very 
		quick way of exposing an Oddjob tree of jobs via the <code>root</code> property.
		
        <p>It is possible to use Oddjob's web server as a general purpose web server with the 
        <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jetty/ResourceHandlerType.html">web:resource</a> hander. Further
        details will be saved for future releases when Oddjob's web offering becomes more stable.
		
		<h4 id="limitations">Limitations</h4>
        
        <p>As already mentioned, Oddjob's web interface is very much a work in progress, and it will certainly 
        be the focus for improvement in coming releases. Here are some of its more notable limitations</p>
		
		<dl>
			<dt>Security</dt>
			<dd><p>There isn't any. Browser based authentication including a read-only role will be added soon.</p></dd>

            <dt>Web Service Documentation</dt>
            <dd><p>There isn't any. It is now possible to start, stop and monitor jobs all via Oddjob's web 
            service. But I'm afraid you will currently have to plough through the code to understand how to do this.
            </p></dd>
            
            <dt>Web Sockets</dt>
            <dd>They isn't any. The asynchronous AJAX bit is done via polling. This will be reworked with web sockets
            in coming releases.</dd>
