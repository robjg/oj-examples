        <h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>

		<p>The idea of a Task was introduced in Oddjob 1.5 as a way to get round the limitations of running 
		jobs remotely with different properties set. Doing this locally has always been relatively simple 
		with <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/input/InputJob.html">input</a> but remotely required waiting for
		for a property to be set.
		</p>
		<p>
		Here's the server side of such an arrangement:
        </p>
        
{@oddjob.xml.file examples/userguide/tasks1.xml}
    
        <p>
        And here's the client side:
        </p>

{@oddjob.xml.file examples/userguide/tasks2.xml}

        <p>The server waits for the <code>greeting</code> property to be set on the 
        <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/values/VariablesJob.html">variables</a> job and then echos
        the value.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Client prompts the user for input and then sets this property remotely with the 
        <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/values/SetJob.html">set</a> job. Now this works, but it's ugly. 
        </p>
        
        <p>Heres the same problem with a 
        <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jobs/tasks/TaskExecutionService.html">task-service</a> on
        the server:</p>
        

{@oddjob.xml.file examples/userguide/tasks3.xml}

        <p>And here's the client:</p>
        
{@oddjob.xml.file examples/userguide/tasks4.xml}

        <p>The client gets input from the user as before, but reads the request from the <code>requests</code>
        property of the service on the server. The 
        <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jobs/tasks/TaskRequest.html">task-request</a> then requests the 
        task executes the request on the service on the server.
        </p>
        <p>
        Both the above examples above can be run by specifying a <code>server.address</code> property when running the client, 
        and running the server with a JMX port as outlined in 
        the <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jmx/JMXServerJob.html">server</a> documentation.
        The client and server can also be run together in the same JVM with no connection property set on the client as
        they are for the tests.
        </p>
        
        <p>When running either the client or server from explorer, if the service is selected the job menu
        contains an 'execute' option, which if selected will prompt for the properties of the task and then
        execute the task.

                height="320" width="500" alt="Executing a Task from Oddjob Explorer"/></a>
                
        <p>The web interface also supports executing jobs and produces pop-up form to prompt for properties
        before executing the task.</p>
        		
        <h4 id="limitations">Limitations</h4>

        <p>The current task service only supports a single execution at a time. If another request occurs while
        the task is executing it will be ignored. A parallel version that supports concurrent executions
        will be developed at some point in the future.
        </p>
