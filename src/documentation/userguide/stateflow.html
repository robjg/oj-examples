	<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>

	<p>Deciding whether something needs to be done or not is often a
	job in itself, and Oddjob takes this view too. Rather than have
	a job that runs if a property is set or a file available, Oddjob has 
	jobs that checks if a property is set 
	(<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jobs/CheckJob.html">check</a>)
	 or a file is available
	(<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/io/ExistsJob.html">exists</a>)	and
	jobs that execute depending on the state of the jobs that did the
	checking.

	<h4 id="ifandtrigger">If and Trigger</h4>

	<p>There are two main jobs that can be used to do something depending on
	the outcome of a job. They are:</p>

	<dl>
	<dt><a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/state/IfJob.html">if</a></dt>
	<dd>Checks the state of it's first child job to decide
	what to do.</dd>
	
	<dt><a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/scheduling/Trigger.html">trigger</a></dt>
	<dd>Execute the child job when a job elsewhere enters a specific state.</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<p>Trigger was introduced in the scheduling section of this manual,
	because it was developed sharing a lot of functionality with timer
	and retry and so was placed in the scheduling namespace. Conceptionally
	though it is more related to the state jobs and so is included here too.
	</p>
	 
	<p>
	The big difference between them is that the <code>if</code> job is synchronous
	and state is evaluated after the child job runs, where as the <code>trigger</code>
	job is asynchronous. Oddjob activates the trigger then moves on to 
	execute the next job. The trigger will then fire (or cancel itself)
	at some point in the future depending on the state of the job it depends
	on.
	</p>

	<h4 id="waitandjoin">Wait and Join</h4>
	
	<p>There are also two jobs that will stop Oddjob from executing 
	anything else until another job is in a certain state. They are:</p>

	<dl>
	<dt><a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/state/JoinJob.html">join</a></dt>
	<dd>Executes it's child and waits for the child to finish
	executing before continuing.</dd>
	
	<dt><a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/scheduling/Trigger.html">wait</a></dt>
	<dd>Waits for a job elsewhere to be in a specific state before
	allowing Oddjob to continue. Wait will also wait for a period of
	time or for a job to have a property before continuing.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>Both these jobs block Oddjob, which is OK in small configurations
	but could leave too many threads blocked and thus hog resources in
	larger deployments. It's
	nearly always possible to come up with an alternative configuration
	using other jobs listed on this page.	
	<p>

	<h4 id="statecondition">State Conditions</h4>

	<p>The <code>join</code> job will only continue it's child job has
	finished running. The <code>if</code>, <code>trigger</code> and 
	<code>wait</code> jobs take a property that is a <i>State Condition</i>
	that tests states to see if the condition is met. This provides
	more flexibility than just checking a job is in a single state. Oddjob
	provides a number of useful State Conditions with a conversion from
	a text constant (you can set the property with a single word).
	</p>
	
	<p>The provided State Conditions are:</p>
	
	<dl>
	<dt>READY</dt>
	<dd>Is a job ready?</dd>

	<dt>RUNNING<dt>
	<dd>Is a job executing or otherwise active?</dd>

	<dt>INCOMPLETE<dt>
	<dd>Is a job incomplete?</dd>
		
	<dt>COMPLETE</dt>
	<dd>Is a job complete?</dd>
	
	<dt>EXCEPTION</dt>
	<dd>Is a job in an exception state?</dd>
	
	<dt>DESTROYED</dt>
	<dd>The job has been destroyed. It can no longer be used. Note that
	 many Jobs that use state conditions will enter an EXCEPTION state
	 if the job they trigger on is destroyed, and so this state
	 condition will not be met.</dd>	
	
	<dt>FAILURE</dt>
	<dd>The state is either INCOMPLETE or EXCEPTION.</dd>
	
	<dt>FINISHED</dt>
	<dd>The state is either COMPLETE, INCOMPLETE or EXCEPTION.</dd>
	
	<dt>EXECUTING</dt>
	<dd>A job state is either EXECUTING or the state of a 
	service is STARTING.</dd>
	
	<dt>STARTED</dt>
	<dd>A service has STARTED.</dd>

	</dl>
	
	<p>An '!' can also be place in front of any of these state
	conditions to negate them.</p>
	
	<p>As stated previously, the <code>join</code> has it's state condition
	hard coded. That value is equivalent to !RUNNING. Note that this is 
	different to FINISHED because finished does not include the READY state.
	</p>

		<h4 id="events">Events</h4>

		<p>Oddjob 1.6 introduces events. The idea is to allow jobs to trigger from events other than state
		changes.</p>

		<p>
			The starting points are:
		</p>

		<dl>
			<dt><a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/events/When.html">events:when</a></dt>
			<dd>When an event occurs run a job. This happens continuously.</dd>

			<dt><a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/events/Trigger.html">events:trigger</a></dt>
			<dd>Run a job once when an event occurs. Subsequent events are ignored.</dd>

		</dl>

		<p>
			Currently supported event types are:
		</p>

		<dl>
			<dt><a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/state/expr/StateExpressionType.html">state:watch</a></dt>
			<dd>Watch job state changes.</dd>

			<dt><a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/io/FileWatchEventSource.html">events:file</a></dt>
			<dd>Watch file events,</dd>

		</dl>

		<p>
			Event logic can be combined with:
		</p>

		<dl>
			<dt><a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/events/ListSource.html">events:list</a></dt>
			<dd>Combine a static list of event sources.</dd>

			<dt><a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/events/ForEvents.html">events:for</a></dt>
			<dd>Combine a dynamic list of event sources</dd>
		</dl>
