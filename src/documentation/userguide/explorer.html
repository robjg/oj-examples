		<h1>Oddjob Explorer</h1>

		<p>Your window on the Oddjob world. Before moving on let's have a quick
		walk through the 
		Oddjob Explorer views and controls.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#panels">The Panels</a></li>
			<li><a href="#file">The File Menu</a></li>
			<li><a href="#edit">The Edit Menu</a></li>
			<li><a href="#job">The Job Menu</a></li>
		</ul>

		<a name="panels"></a>
		<h4>The Panels</h4>
		
		<dl>
		<dt>Job Tree Panel</dt>
		<dd><p>Displays the hierarchy of jobs.</p></dd>

		<dt>Detail View</dt>
		<dd><p>Displays detail on a job selected in the tree view. It consists of
		four panels:</p>

		<dl>
		<dt>State Panel</dt>
		<dd><p>Displays the current state of a job, where available. The time
		is the time the job changed to that state and the exception is the
		full stack trace of the cause of the job being in an exception state.
		</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Console Panel</dt>
		<dd><p>Displays messages written to the console of the job being run. The
		console is shared at a process level so in any one jobs console view you
		will see messages from all jobs in the same process.</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Log Panel</dt>
		<dd><p>Displays log messages produced by the job, where available. Log
		messages are of different levels, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR 
		and FATAL. Each level message is displayed in a different colour.
		</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Properties Panel</dt>
		<dd><p>Displays the properties of a job. Some of these properties are
		visible before a job is run because they are constant or default values,
		some will only be available when the job has run.
		</p></dd>
		</dl>
		</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<a name="file"></a>
		<h4>File Menu</h4>
		
		<a href="images/explorer1.gif"><img src="images/explorer1.gif" 
				height="200" width="300" alt="The File Menu"/></a>
				
		<dl>
		<dt>New Explorer</dt>
		<dd><p>Creates a new Explorer window.</p></dd>
		
		<dt>New Oddjob</dt>
		<dd><p>Creates a new Oddbjob configuration.</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Open</dt>
		<dd><p>Starts Oddjob with the selected configuration file.</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Close</dt>
		<dd><p>Closes the current view and destroys the internal Oddjob. Both
		Open and Exit perform these actions so Close won't be used much.</p>
		<p>Note:
		you can not close the current view until all local running jobs have
		completed or have been stopped. If a job won't stop then you must
		kill the Oddjob Explorer process. This strategy ensures that no processes
		are left running that a user is unaware of.</p></dd>

		<dt>Save</dt>
		<dd><p>Saves the Oddjob configuration of the currently selected jobs Oddjob,
		or the root Oddjob if no job is selected.</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Save As</dt>
		<dd><p>Saves the root Oddjob configuration in a different file.</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Recent History</dt>		
		<dd><p>Displays recent file history. Recent file history is stored in
		the directory used to launch Oddjob. When you change this directory
		you loose this history. Launching two Oddjob Explorers will 
		confuse history and only that of the last closed will 
		be persisted.</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Exit</dt>
		<dd><p>Performs a Close action and then exits Oddjob Explorer. 
		The same as closing the main window.</p></dd>
		</dl>

		<a name="edit"></a>
		<h4>Edit Menu</h4>
		
		<a href="images/explorer2.gif"><img src="images/explorer2.gif" 
				height="200" width="300" alt="The Job Menu"/></a>
				
		<dl>
		<dt>Cut</dt>
		<dd><p>Delete the current job after copying its configuration to the 
		clip-board.</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Copy</dt>
		<dd><p>Copy the current job's configuration to the clip-board.</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Paste</dt>
		<dd><p>Paste configuration from the clip-board to create a child job of
		the current job.</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Delete</dt>
		<dd><p>Delete the current job.</p></dd>
		</dl>
				
		<a name="jobs"></a>
		<h4>Job Menu</h4>
		
		<p>
		The Job Menu applies to the job currently selected in the tree view.
		Here a nested Oddjob job has been selected.
		</p>

				height="200" width="300" alt="The Job Menu"/></a>
		
				
		<dl>
		<dt>Load</dt>
		<dd><p>For jobs that can load a configuration, such as Oddjob, this action 
		will load the configuration without running it. If a job can't
		load a configuration (and most can't) this option won't appear.</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Unload</dt>
		<dd><p>For jobs that have loaded a configuration, such as Oddjob, this action 
		will unload a configuration. Again this option will normally not
		be visible.</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Run</dt>
		<dd><p>Runs a job immediately.</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Soft Reset</dt>
		<dd><p>Performs a soft reset on the job.</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Hard Reset</dt>
		<dd><p>Performs a hard reset on the job.</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Stop</dt>
		<dd><p>Stops the job.</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Set Property</dt>
		<dd><p>Sets a property of a job.</p>
		
		<p>Here's an example of changing the text property of the Echo job.</p>
		
		<a href="images/explorer5.gif"><img src="images/explorer5.gif" 
		height="200" width="300" alt="Setting a Property Job"/></a>
		
		<p>Note that unlike changing configuration this change will be lost
		when the job is destroyed. If the property is being set at runtime 
		(see later) Oddjob will also overwrite anything set with this option.
		</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Designer</dt>
		<dd><p>Launches Oddjob Designer which allows the configuration of the currently
		selected job to be changed.</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Design Inside</dt>
		<dd><p>For a job that owns a configuration, such as Oddjob, this allows
		the internal configuration of that job to to be changed. This option
		is only enabled once the configuration has been loaded either with 
		the Load and because the job has been run.</p></dd>
		
		<dt>Add Job</dt>
		<dd><p>For a job that supports children this is quick way to add
		a child Job. It is often more convenient than using Designer 
		to add the job.</p></dd>
		
		</dl>
		
		<p>Here is another view of the job menu, this time a Sequential job 
		is selected so we can see the Add Job option.</p>
