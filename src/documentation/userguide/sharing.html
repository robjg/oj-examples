	<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
		
		<p>Oddjob makes working with jobs on a remote server virtually
		transparent.</p> 
		
		<p>Here's a a world according to Oddjob:</p>
		
		<a href="images/sharing1.gif"><img src="images/sharing1.gif" 
			height="320" width="500" alt="My Oddjob World"/></a>
		
		<p>It has local jobs but also has connections to three servers
		running anywhere on the network.</p>
				
		<p>Setting up Oddjob for sharing is easy. Create an Oddjob for your
		view of the world and add a 
		<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jmx/JMXClientJob.html">client</a> 
		job for each server you want to connect to. When the client runs 
		all the server jobs magically appear. They aren't quite real though,
		they are only reflections of the server jobs.</p>

		<p>If we stop the client, the reflected server jobs disappear,
		but they are still running on the server.</p>
		
		<a href="images/sharing2.gif"><img src="images/sharing2.gif" 
			height="320" width="500" alt="Jobs Disappear"/></a>
				
		<p>Here, the client jobs named Server 1 and Server 2 have been stopped and
		the client job named Server 3 is about to be stopped.</p>

	<h4 id="working">Working With Remote Jobs</h4>		
		
		<p>Working with the local reflection of a remote job is no different
 		to working with a local job except that the action takes place on the 
 		server.</p>

		<p>Lets work through some examples, but as I'm not going to explain
		how to set up servers until you're completely persuaded by the magic of sharing
		you might wish to work with one I created earlier. It's in the 
		<code>examples/userguide</code> directory and it's called <code>sharingMain.xml</code>.
		Open and run it in Oddjob explorer, and if you're on Windows you will 
		something like this:</p>

		<a href="images/sharing3.gif"><img src="images/sharing3.gif" 
			height="320" width="500" alt="Starting Some Servers"/></a>
				
		<p>Three console windows will appear, which are the 3 server processes. If 
		they don't appear then you might need to change the <code>runnOddjob</code>
		property in the variables. If you are not on windows, you will also have to
		change the three ExecJob configurations.</p>				

		<p>Lets run a job on Server 1. Run the client called
		Server 1 and expanded the job tree to see the jobs we've got on Server 1.
		Ignore the Server 2 and Server 3 jobs (they are for later) but run 
		the Job 'Echo To Console'.</p>

		<a href="images/sharing4.gif"><img src="images/sharing4.gif" 
			height="320" width="500" alt="Running A Job"/></a>

		<p>Now take a look at the console window for Server 1.</p>
				
		<a href="images/sharing5.gif"><img src="images/sharing5.gif" 
			height="320" width="500" alt="Console for Server 1"/></a>
			
		<p>Oddjob reflects the console of the server locally.</p>
					
		<a href="images/sharing6.gif"><img src="images/sharing6.gif" 
			height="320" width="500" alt="Console in Explorer"/></a>
				
		<p>And also the Log output for the server job is reflected locally. 
		These features make supporting
		applications on remote servers much easier.</p>

		<p>Resetting and Stopping jobs work just as transparently. So does setting
		a property.</p>
		
		<a href="images/sharing7.gif"><img src="images/sharing7.gif" 
			height="320" width="500" alt="Setting a Property"/></a>
				
		<p>And the proof...</p>
		
		<a href="images/sharing8.gif"><img src="images/sharing8.gif" 
			height="320" width="500" alt="Console Again"/></a>
				
		<p>Setting a property is only temporary, if the server is restarted the
		configured value is reused. If the configured value was a runtime property 
		(in ${} form) the runtime property will be reset when the job is run. Fortunately
		oddjob allows you to permanently change the remote configuration as well.</p>
		
	<h4 id="configuring">Server Drag And Drop</h4>		
		
		<p>Oddjob Makes configuring remote jobs wonderfully simple too. Lets start our client
		to Server 2 and drag our Important Job 1 to Server 2.</p>
		
		<a href="images/sharing9.gif"><img src="images/sharing9.gif" 
			height="320" width="500" alt="Dragging"/></a>
	
		<p>And run it.</p>
					
		<a href="images/sharing10.gif"><img src="images/sharing10.gif" 
			height="320" width="500" alt="Running"/></a>
				
		<p>And configure it.</p>
		
		<a href="images/sharing11.gif"><img src="images/sharing11.gif" 
			height="320" width="500" alt="Configuring"/></a>
				
		<p>And run it again.</p>
		
		<a href="images/sharing12.gif"><img src="images/sharing12.gif" 
			height="320" width="500" alt="Run It Again"/></a>

		<p>You Try...</p>
		
		<p>Now stop having fun and pay attention because this is really important.
		What we are changing is an in memory copy of the configuration on the server.
		If you restart the server then this configuration is lost. 
		To save this back to the configuration file on the server you must have any job
		in that configuration selected, and then select save from the menu.</p>
				
		<a href="images/sharing13.gif"><img src="images/sharing13.gif" 
			height="320" width="500" alt="Saving"/></a>
				
		<p>Now the file <code>sharingJob2.xml</code> has the changes.</p>
		
<pre class="xml">
&lt;oddjob xmlns:jmx="http://rgordon.co.uk/oddjob/jmx"&gt;
    &lt;job&gt;
        &lt;folder name="Jobs On Server 2"&gt;
            &lt;jobs&gt;
                &lt;echo id="echo2" text="Important Job 2"/&gt;
                &lt;echo id="echo1" text="Important Job 1 (Now On Server 2)"/&gt;
                &lt;jmx:client id="server1" name="Server 1" url="service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost/oddjob-server-1"/&gt;
                &lt;jmx:client id="server3" name="Server 3" url="service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost/oddjob-server-3"/&gt;
            &lt;/jobs&gt;
        &lt;/folder&gt;
    &lt;/job&gt;
&lt;/oddjob&gt;
</pre>

		<p>Now I admit that having Save associated with the file menu, not the job
		menu, and having no warning that configuration has changed, and not knowing
		if someone else has changed the configuration isn't great. But this will
		be fixed soon. I promise.</p>
		 
		<p>Now just to counter those slight negative vibes you might be getting - 
		let me point out one cool feature about nested Oddjobs. When you create 
		new nested Oddjob, the nested Oddjob's configuration
		file will be created on the server, 
		(when you save that nested Oddjob)
		No server access required! .</p>
		

	<h4 id="multiple">Connecting Multiple Servers</h4>		
		
		<p>Clients and Servers can be linked together to enable jobs to be
		visible across several servers:</p>
		
		<p>This is achieved simply by adding a client job to the server configuration.
		What we've got in our example is this:</p>
		
		<img src="images/sharing-dia1.jpg" alt="Linked Servers"/>
	
		<p>So we (Us) have access to all three servers directly, but each server
		has access to the other two servers. Lets see how that looks in
		Oddjob Explorer.</p>
		
		<a href="images/sharing14.gif"><img src="images/sharing14.gif" 
			height="320" width="500" alt="More Servers"/></a>
				
		<p>We're now seeing Server 2 via Server 1, including it's 
		console output. The same complete server transparency but 
		across multiple servers.</p>
		
		<p>The server has built in loop back detection
		to detect the situation when a client loops back to the originating 
		server. The Server 1 client on Server 2 no longer shows any 
		children when viewed from our original Server 1 client. If you're 
		confused, I'm talking about the selected Job in the picture above.</p>
		
		<h4 id="accessing">Accessing Server Jobs</h4>		
		
		<p>Accessing a remote job
		and it's properties from a configuration file is a virtually seamless
		transition from working with a nested Oddjob job. A job is accessible
		using the notation ${client-id/id-of-job-on-server}.
		</p>
		
	<h4 id="server">The Server Side</h4>
				
		<p>Setting up Oddjob as a server is easy too. First the really easy way.</p>
		
		<p>Oddjob comes packaged with a server.xml and a client.xml file. Run 
		the server.xml and you have a server.</p>
		
<pre class="command">
java -jar run-oddjob.jar -f server.xml
</pre>			

		<p>Connect to server by opening client.xml in Oddjob Explorer and
		start configuring...</p>
		
		<a href="images/sharing15.gif"><img src="images/sharing15.gif" 
			height="320" width="500" alt="Editing The Default"/></a>

		<p>To understand what's going on let's take a look at the 
		server.xml.</p>

{@oddjob.xml.file ../oddjob/server.xml}	

		<p>The job that provides the sharing functionality is 
		the <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/jmx/JMXServerJob.html">server</a>
		job. This job shares the local jobs from the given root job down.
		In this case the root job is a nested Oddjob called Server Jobs.</p>
		
		<p>The server uses 
		<a href="http://java.sun.com/jmx">JMX (Java Management Extensions)</a> 
		which you don't need to know anything about except that 
		the JMX protocol our server is using requires an RMI 
		registry to be running somewhere, and we ensure this is the
		case by running one ourselves via the preceding 
		<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/rmi/RMIRegistryJob.html">rmireg</a>
		job. If an RMI server is already running on our machine, our Registry 
		Job will 
		silently complete. The URL is the only other confusing thing and 
		that becomes less confusing when you know that all you need to worry
		about is the last path element which is the name the server will be
		registered by in the registry and must be unique for each server job
		on each machine.</p>

		<p>For those that would like to know more about JMX and the URL format
		it's in
		<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jmx/JMX_1_4_specification.pdf">
		The JMX Specification</a>, but for those that aren't too bothered by
		how it works - just cut and paste.
		</p>
		
		<p>There is no limit to the number of server jobs you have in an
		Oddjob configuration or which jobs they share. A server could share
		a folder that contains itself allowing the client to shut it
		down. A master or administrator server could share several child servers, perhaps
		running jobs for different departments. In this respect the server job 
		is very flexible.</p>
		
		<p>One caveat about remote configuration. Oddjob can share any job and it's children, 
		but configuration will only work from an Oddjob node down. That is why the first
		node to be shared will often be an Oddjob job.</p>
