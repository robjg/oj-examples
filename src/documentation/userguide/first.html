		<h4 id="creating">Creating a Configuration File</h4>
		
		<p>So you've downloaded and installed Oddjob. You've started Oddjob
		Explorer and run through the examples. Now you want Oddjob to do 
		something useful for you.</p>
		
		<p>In the first instance we'll assume this useful thing is in the form of
		running a batch file and that you would like this useful thing done at 
		regular intervals.</p>
		
		<p>To get Oddjob to do anything, it needs a configuration file which 
		contains the 'jobs' that Oddjob will run. To create our first
		configuration file we will use Oddjob's GUI Designer. From the <b>File</b> menu
		of Oddjob Explorer choose <b>New</b>. Select the root 'Oddjob' node in the
		tree view and right click - then choose <b>Designer</b>.</p>

		<h4 id="ajob">Adding a Job</h4>
		
		<p>To create a job for Oddjob to run we must select something from the Job 
		property drop-down box. Here we choose 'exec' which is the job that
		executes a system command.</p>
		
		<p>Now to specify the command to run. For this example we're going to
		borrow the batch file from Oddjob's examples folder. Select the newly 
		created ExecJob node in the Designer Job Tree and then in the detail
		panel click on the 'Command' field 
		and enter.</p>

<pre>
cmd /C examples\exec\bin\greeting.bat hello
</pre>
		
		<p><i>Obviously this is command is only for Windows users but you users
		on other platforms are bright enough to realize this and substitute an
		equivalent command.</i></p>
		
		<a href="images/first2.gif"><img src="images/first2.gif" 
			height="320" width="500" alt="Exec Command"/></a>
		
		<p>And that's it - We're done. Click OK on the design panel to return
		to Oddjob Explorer where we can expand the tree to see our jobs.

		<h4 id="running">Running Your Job</h4>
		
		<p>You can run the job just like any other job and see the 
		results in the 'Console'
		tab in the right hand detail panel.</p>
		
		<a href="images/first3.gif"><img src="images/first3.gif" 
			height="320" width="500" alt="Schedule Menu"/></a>
		
		<p>When you close Oddjob this configuration will be lost. If you don't want to 
		loose this precious work 
		Select <b>Save</b> from the <b>File</b> menu and pick a file to save it too. The
		file name and extension can be anything but the underlying configuration is in 
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> so it's probably sensible to call it 
		<i>something</i>.xml</p>
