		<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
		
		<p>Whether it's a server crash or a deliberate restart, we want
		our scheduled job sequences to know where they were. We want them
		to recover. We want them to pick themselves up, dust themselves off 
		and to carry on as if nothing had happened.</p>
		
		<p>Oddjob helps it's jobs to have this resilience by providing a
		facility for jobs to save their state. Oddjob leaves it to each 
		job to decide when to request it's state be saved, and then delegates
		the request to a 
		<i>persister</i>. The persister is a configured property of Oddjob. It is set
		by the aptly named 'persister' property. By default Oddjob has no persister
		configured and so all requests to save state are thrown away. When Oddjob 
		restarts everything is created a fresh. Five hour reports are ready to run
		again blissfully unaware that they only completed ten minutes ago and
		scheduled jobs take an ill-informed decision based on their configuration alone 
		whether to run immediately or miss today all together.</p>
		
		<p>Out of the box Oddjob provides two types of persister: A
		<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/persist/FilePersister.html">file-persister</a> 
		that saves state to the local file system, and a 
		<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/sql/SQLPersisterService.html">sql-persister-service</a>
		that saves state to a database. The reference pages explain each adequately,
		however some extra background about Persisters might be be useful.</p>
		
		<h4 id="property">The Persister Property</h4>		
		
		<p>Now for those who've been paying attention there should be some
		confusion because when we create a new Oddjob there is no persister 
		property!</p>

		<p>So how do I explain... Oddjob is a job that loads a configuration, and 
		what we are editing is that configuration, not the configuration for Oddjob
		itself. There is a persister property on the Oddjob that Oddjob Explorer
		has created, but Oddjob Explorer doesn't let us 
		set that. The reasoning behind this is that most of the time Oddjob will
		be running on a server and so Oddjob will need to be configured via some
		kind of configuration file, and what's a great way of configuring things? 
		Why Oddjob of course.</p>
		
		<p>To configure Oddjob, we use Oddjob. Think of it kind of like 
		boot-strapping. lets set Oddjob to be our only job, and then we
		can configure the persister:</p>
			
		<a href="images/saving1.gif"><img src="images/saving1.gif" 
			height="320" width="500" alt="The Persister Property"/></a>
		
		<h4 id="ids">Persistence and Identity</h4>		
			
		<p>Both our file and SQL persisters use the id of a job. Job's are stored 
		and restored by id. JOBS WITHOUT AN ID ARE NOT STORED.</p>
		
		<p>Once a persister has been configured on Oddjob it applies to all
		nested Oddjobs until a nested Oddjob has a different persister configured.
		It's not possible for two jobs within an Oddjob configuration to have 
		the same id, but it is possible for two jobs within different nested Oddjob 
		configurations to have the same id. The path to each is however different.
		Our persister uses the paths to differentiate between the two. For there
		to be a valid path to our jobs each Oddjob between the persister and
		the job must have an id.
		
		Some jobs aren't persisted even with an id. They are termed Transient jobs.
		Oddjob is an example of such a job. It's state is purely derived from it's 
		child.
				
		<h4 id="deleting">Removing Persisted State</h4>		
				
		<p>Persisted state deletion isn't an exact science but it sort of makes sense
		in most situations. Here's the rules:</p>
		
		<p>1. When a job is destroyed (deleted, dragged, cut or it's 
		configuration is edited) it's persisted state is removed.</p>
		
		<p>
		2. Except Oddjob - when Oddjob is destroyed (deleted, dragged, cut or it's
		configuration is edited, or the oddjob instance is shutdown, via Explorer or 
		using Ctrl-C) nothing is removed, not any of it's child jobs or any nested
		Oddjobs.
				
		<p>The ambiguity arises because Oddjob doesn't know if it's being destroyed
		as the result of shutdown or as the result of a configuration edit. This will
		be fixed in future releases.</p>
				
		<h4 id="archiving">Archiving</h4>		
		
		<p>Oddjob is able record snapshot of the state of it's children. It 
		achieves this using a 
		<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/persist/ArchiveJob.html">archive</a>
		job. This will capture a 'silhouette' of it's child's state and
		properties, and it's children's children, so long as the are in the
		current Oddjob Session. It won't capture the state of remote jobs
		or jobs in a nested Oddjob.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		An archive can be viewed with an
		<a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/persist/ArchiveBrowserJob.html">archive-browser</a>
		</p>
		
		<a href="images/saving2.gif"><img src="images/saving2.gif" 
			height="320" width="500" alt="The Persister Property"/></a>

		<p>Running the browser displays the available archived runs as child 
		jobs. Running one of these instances shows the silhouettes 
		captured by the archiver.</p>				
		
		<p>Archiving, and Oddjob persistence in general doesn't persist
		logs. It is planned to add this at some point.</p>
