		<p>Running Oddjob from Code.</p>

	</ul>

	<h4 id="simple">A Simple Example</h4>
	
	<p>It's Hello World of course:</p>

	{@oddjob.java.file src/test/java/org/oddjob/devguide/EmbeddingTest.java#first}
 
 	<p>Which is:</p>
 	<ol>
 	 <li>Create an instance of Oddjob.</li>
 	 <li>Give Oddjob some configuration. In this case it's a string of xml,
 	 but it could be a file, or a class path resource.</li>
 	 <li>Run Oddjob.</li>
 	</ol>
 	
 	<p>And that's it.</p>
 	
	<h4 id="lookup">Looking Up Beans</h4>
	
	<p>With three lines of code it's possible to get at all Objects that have
	been registered within Oddjob with their id attribute. Because 
	three lines of code seemed a bit much a utility class 
	<a href="@javadoc@/org/oddjob/OddjobLookup">OddjobLookup</a> was created.</p>
	
	<p>We can now get there in one line thus:</p>
	
	{@oddjob.java.file src/test/java/org/oddjob/devguide/EmbeddingTest.java#second}

	<p>By providing the property type, Oddjob will do the conversion for us. There is 
	also a lookup method that doesn't take the second argument and returns
	the raw Object</p>
	
	<h4 id="finally">Cleaning Up</h4>
	
	<p>And when you've finished with Oddjob we mustn't forget to clear those 
	resources:</p>
	
	{@oddjob.java.file src/test/java/org/oddjob/devguide/EmbeddingTest.java#last}

	<p>If you don't do this, it's possible that threads will be left running.</p>
