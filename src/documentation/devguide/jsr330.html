	<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

	<p>The Arooa framework also supports the automatic injection of 
	properites by using the <code>@Inject</code> annotation specified
	by JSR 330.
	</p>

	<p>Support for the standard is not complete within Oddjob. In particular only
 	the <code>@Named</code> qualifier is supported. Other <code>@Qualifier</code>s will
 	be ignored. 
	</p>	
	
	<p>During Arooa's configuration cycle, when it finds a property
	requiring automatic dependency injection, it interrogates all 
	components in the configuration that implement the
	<a href="@javadoc@/org/oddjob/arooa/registry/ServiceProvider.html">ServiceProvider</a>
	interface for a matching Object to inject. If none is found Arooa moves
	on without a warning. 
	</p>
	
	<p>Now I hope that so far you're impressed by how much you can achieve
	with Oddjob while keeping your code independent of Oddjob and we don't
	want to spoil this by having your service beans implement some Oddjob interface.
	Well we don't, because Oddjob has a job for that.</p> 
	
	<h4 id="servicesjob">The Services Job</h4>

	<p>The services job takes the objects registered with it, and provides
	them to Arooa as potential canidates for automatic dependency injection.
	This job is so named because within Oddjob the injected objects will 
	typically be services that other jobs require to perform their tasks.
	</p>
	
 	<p>The easist way to learn about the service job is via example. Here's
 	a simple example - a hungry job requires a snack to do some work.
 	</p>
 		
	<p>Here's the hungry job. Note the use of <code>@inject</code></p>
	
{@oddjob.java.file src/test/java/org/oddjob/devguide/ServicesJobExamplesTest.java#HungryJob}
   
	<p>The hungry job uses a <code>SnackProvider</code> to retrieve it's snack.
	</p>

{@oddjob.java.file src/test/java/org/oddjob/devguide/ServicesJobExamplesTest.java#SnackProvider}

	<p>A snack is just:</p>

{@oddjob.java.file src/test/java/org/oddjob/devguide/ServicesJobExamplesTest.java#Snack}

	<p>And here's our <code>SnackProvider</code>, A cafe.</p>
	
{@oddjob.java.file src/test/java/org/oddjob/devguide/ServicesJobExamplesTest.java#Cafe}

	<p>Here's the Oddjob configuration that ties it all together. Our cafe
	is registered with the services job. When the hungry job is configured, 
	our services job provides the cafe as the service for injection.</p>
	
{@oddjob.xml.file examples/devguide/ServicesExample.xml}

	<p>Here's the output:</p>
	
<pre class="command">
Snack eaten: Green Eggs and Ham.
</pre>
	
 	<p>For when a job requires a more specialised service there is the
 	<code>@Named</code> qualifier. Here our hungry Job is vegetarian.</p>

{@oddjob.java.file src/test/java/org/oddjob/devguide/ServicesJobExamplesTest.java#HungryVegetarianJob}

	<p>But fortunately a vegetarian cafe is available.
	</p>
	 
{@oddjob.java.file src/test/java/org/oddjob/devguide/ServicesJobExamplesTest.java#VegetarianCafe}
 
 	<p>Here's the modified configuration with both types of hungry job, 
 	and the output.</p>
 	
 {@oddjob.xml.file examples/devguide/ServicesQualifiedExample.xml}
 
<pre class="command">
Snack eaten: Green Eggs and Ham.
Snack eaten: Salad.
</pre>
 
	<p>If there is no service that matches the qualifier, as here:</p>
	 
{@oddjob.xml.file examples/devguide/ServicesAnyExample.xml}
  
  <p>By default, if no service matching the qualifier can be provided, the
  first service of the correct type is used. As in this example, this can 
  result in our vegetarian being given something it shouldn't eat.</p>
  
<pre class="command">
Snack eaten: Green Eggs and Ham.
</pre>
    
   <p>The intransigent property can be used to ensure only an exact match
   is chosen.</p>
   
{@oddjob.xml.file examples/devguide/ServicesIntransigentExample2.xml}
  
  <p>The default cafe is not automatically injected. Our Hungry vegetarian must
  be prepared to not get a snack.</p>
  
{@oddjob.java.file src/test/java/org/oddjob/devguide/ServicesJobExamplesTest.java#ResilientVegetarianJob}

	<p>Our resilient hungry job handles the lack of a snack provider with only 
	minimal fuss!</p>
	
<pre class="command">
No Snack!
</pre>
  
	<p>And that is how to get started with automatically 
	injecting your services into your jobs.</p>
