		<h4 id="completion">Comletion States</h4>
		
		<p>So far we've written a nice job that run's without errors - but
		what happens if something goes wrong?</p>
		
		<p>Oddjob will catch all Throwables during job execution and 
		set the job state to Exception. Let see with an example.</p>
		
{@oddjob.java.file src/java/org/oddjob/devguide/NaughtyJob.java}

		<p>And run it...</p>
		
		<a href="images/naughty.gif"><img src="images/naughty.gif"
			height="200" width="300" alt="A Naughty Job"/></a>
				
		<p>You can try resetting the job and re-running it however 
		this job will not start behaving! The import thing is that 
		it's naughtiness is contained.</p>
		
		<p>Oddjob will also recognise the result property and use it
		to either set a job complete or not complete. If the result
		is 0 the job is state is complete, any other value and it's 
		not complete.</p>
		
{@oddjob.java.file src/java/org/oddjob/devguide/NotCompleteJob.java}

		<p>And run it...</p>
		
		<a href="images/notcomplete.gif"><img src="images/notcomplete.gif"
			height="200" width="300" alt="A Naughty Job"/></a>
						

	<h4 id="stopping">Stopping a Job</h4>
		
		<p>To stop a job Oddjob will interrupt the thread it's running. 
		Long running jobs should be written to cope with this.
		</p>
		
		<p>Here's an example.</p>

{@oddjob.java.file src/java/org/oddjob/devguide/StoppingJob.java}
		
		<h4 id="logging">Logging</h4>

		<p>Oddjob uses <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j">log4j</a>. If
		you also use Log4j, any logging in your job's <code>run()</code> method
		will be captured by Oddjob and displayed in the log panel of Oddjob 
		Explorer.

		<h4 id="services">Services</h4>

		<p>Sometimes you don't want a job to run and complete,
		but to keep running in the background, probably providing some
		kind of service, such as Scheduling.</p>
		
		<p>
		Oddjob will recognise the method signature of 
		<code>public void start()</code> and <code>public void stop()</code> and
		treat that object as a service. When you run the job, the start
		method will be called, but when it returns the state will still
		be seen as executing. The service will be stopped when you
		stop the job.
		</p>
		
		<p>Here's an example.</p>
		
{@oddjob.java.file src/java/org/oddjob/devguide/SimpleService.java}

		<p>A service has the advantage that when used in a sequential
		job, jobs after the service will run once the
		service has started, and can then use that service for something.</p>

		<h4 id="serialization">Serialization</h4>

		<p>If your job implements <code>java.io.Serializable</code> and Oddjob is
		running with a persister then Oddjob will serialise the state of your
		job when it completes. When Oddjob next runs, it re-creates the 
		job from the serialised form.</p>
		
		<p>After your job is restored, Oddjob will continue to configure your
		job from the configuration file. Thus any serialised properties that
		appear in the configuration will be overwritten.</p>
