	<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

		<p>Arooa should actually be A.R.O.O.A but that's ugly and quite slow
		to type, so it's Arooa. I pronounce it like Aruba but without the 'b'.
		</p>
		
		<p>A.R.O.O.A stands for <b>A</b> <b>R</b>ip <b>O</b>ff <b>O</b>f <b>A</b>nt,
		and as it started life as a cut and paste of the Ant XML framework this
		is quite appropriate. After the decision was made to go POJO the code base
		changed quite a bit and it no longer resembles Ant much, but the name is
		cool.</p> 
		
		<p>So what does Arooa do? It does all the underlying creation and 
		configuration of jobs. It does the runtime property injection. It provides
		the facility for component cut and paste.</p>

		<p>Arooa is a self contained package within oddjob. If you wanted a
		framework for your POJOs that provided drag and drop between 
		configuration files - you could do worse than copy the 
		<code>org.odddjob.arooa</code>
		package and start hacking. You might wish to call it ArooArooa, but
		then again you might not.</p>
	
		<h4 id="components">Components</h4>
		
		<p>
		Arooa, like many application frameworks, uses the idea of a component. There are
		many definitions of a component, but in Arooa it is simply a Java Bean. So a component
		is any <code>java.lang.Object</code> with a no argument constructor.</p>
	
		<p>Here is a really simple component.</p>
		
{@oddjob.java.file src/java/org/oddjob/devguide/FirstComponent.java}

		<p>You can fire this up with oddjob
		using the following configuration:
		</p>
		
{@oddjob.xml.file examples/devguide/component.xml}
	
		<p>Because our component isn't Runnable, Oddjob isn't 
		treating it as a job, so you get a boring icon and
		you can see some properties - but not much else.</p>


	<a href="images/arooa1.gif"><img src="images/arooa1.gif"

	<p>Despite Oddjob not being particularly interested in
	our simple component we'll keep going with Oddjob as the
	basis for our introduction of Arooa, as that's how we'll
	most often use it. Let's look at configuration.</p>
	
	<h4 id="properties">Property Injection</h4>
	
	<p>Properties of our Java Objects are injected using the standard
	Java Bean setter methods.</p>
	
{@oddjob.java.file src/java/org/oddjob/devguide/SecondComponent.java}

	<p>For the properties of primitive types, 
	their Object counterparts, or String, the property is provided in
	the XML configuration as an attribute. The attribute name corresponds to the
	property name.</p>
	
{@oddjob.xml.file examples/devguide/component2.xml}

	<p>When loaded in Oddjob we see our property has been set.</p>

	<a href="images/arooa2.gif"><img src="images/arooa2.gif"
				height="200" width="300" alt="First Component"/></a>
	
	<p>This attribute value is said to be constant because it doesn't
	contain any runtime properties, i.e. no ${} expressions. Constant
	attribute values are set when the configuration file is first loaded.
	
	Runtime properties are set only when the framework is asked to
	<i>configure</i> a component. If we make our component Runnable, 
	Oddjob will wrap it in a Proxy object that will ask Arooa to
	configure our component just before the run method is called.</p>
	
	<p>Arooa also supports setting indexed properties with a <code>
	setXXX(int index, Object value)</code> method and mapped properties
	with a <code>setXXX(String key, Object value)</code> method.</p>
	
	<p>Here's an example which has all three property types:</p>
	
{@oddjob.java.file src/java/org/oddjob/devguide/DifferentPropertiesJob.java}

	<p>In the XML configuration, the index is taken from the element order
	for indexed properties, and the key is taken from a special 'key'
	attribute for mapped properties.</p>
	
{@oddjob.xml.file examples/devguide/properties.xml}

	<p>Here's the result:</p>
	
	<a href="images/arooa4.gif"><img src="images/arooa4.gif"
				height="200" width="300" alt="Properties"/></a>
	
	<p>Now try resetting Oddjob. Do you see the nulls?</p>
	
	<a href="images/arooa5.gif"><img src="images/arooa5.gif"
				height="200" width="300" alt="Properties Destroyed"/></a>

	<p>What's happened? When Oddjob resets it destroys the Arooa configuration
	that it created. During destruction the framework sets null values into 
	all it's configured setters. This came as a by-product of cut and paste
	but as it forces cleanup it seems like a good idea even for properties
	that don't support cut and paste. When capturing
	indexed and mapped properties we have to write the setters quite
	carefully. Here's an example:</p>
	
{@oddjob.java.file src/java/org/oddjob/devguide/IndexedAndMappedJob.java}

	<p>Now this does mean that we can't support a deliberate null in a list or a map
	but as yet this hasn't been a problem.</p>

	<h4 id="values">Values</h4>
	
	<p>To define more complicated properties of a component, Arooa has
	the idea of <i>values</i>. A value, like a component, is a Java Bean.
	Here's one.</p>
	
{@oddjob.java.file src/java/org/oddjob/devguide/Person.java}

	<p>And here's a component that uses it.</p>

{@oddjob.java.file src/java/org/oddjob/devguide/ThirdComponent.java}

	<p>Because our value is not one of the primitives or a String,
	the property is defined
	in the XML configuration as a child element where the element name corresponds to the 
	property name.</p>
		
{@oddjob.xml.file examples/devguide/component3.xml}

	<p>And here's what it looks like in Oddjob.</p>

	<a href="images/arooa3.gif"><img src="images/arooa3.gif"
				height="200" width="300" alt="Values"/></a>


	<p>But our person hasn't been set! - Why not? All Values 
	(even ones with constant properties) are only 
	set during runtime configuration. And that's not
	happening of course, because our component isn't Runnable.</p>
	
	<p>Here's a Runnable version. I've added a 'formal' property to 
	change the style of greeting - because I was getting
	bored (The main cause of feature creep!):</p>
	
{@oddjob.java.file src/java/org/oddjob/devguide/HelloPersonJob.java}

	<p>The configuration is pretty much as is, except with formal set
	to true.</p> 

{@oddjob.xml.file examples/devguide/helloperson.xml}

	<p>Ah! but note the <a href="@reference@/org/oddjob/arooa/types/IsType.html">&lt;is&gt;</a>
	element. Because our property is a Java Bean type we can use this shorthand to
	save typing the class. We can't use &lt;is&gt; for our component definition because
	the job property of Oddjob is of type <code>java.lang.Object</code>, so &lt;is&gt; would
	just create an Object - not much use.
	</p>
	
	<p>Now when we open our configuration in Oddjob Explorer:</p>
	
	<a href="images/arooa6.gif"><img src="images/arooa6.gif"
				height="200" width="300" alt="Hello Person Loaded"/></a>

	<p>Our person property still isn't set (but the constant formal property
	has been). However when we run the job, the property gets set.</p>
	
	<a href="images/arooa7.gif"><img src="images/arooa7.gif"
				height="200" width="300" alt="Hello Person Run"/></a>

	<p>And that is a very brief introduction into Arooa.</p>
